1. on the page cart component i can't access the fields from the cart (the data was
   taken from the redux but not from the server, does it make a difference? )
   A.you cant change the values of these variables you can send it through actions

2. when changing the redux, is the data that i am holding in other places in that same component
   automatically changed or do i have to refresh it again? (like by using selector again) 
   A. no need to refresh

3. When do i load to the redux? why cant i do it all together when the 
   App.js arrives to the DOM and that way to save this action in every component that needs this data?
   A.so that you only make the server "work" hard only when you need it and not for everything.

4. When do i use useEffect? and when does it rehappen ?
    A. it happens in our eyes once and you use it when you need data from the redux but it might be empty



    fix that the pusrchase list shouldn t b eemtpy
